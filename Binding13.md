## *My Thoughts* üí≠
I found this book to be truly real. In the most heartbreaking way the book was filled with nothing but raw and intense moments that shoked me at times. Is a book that I wouldn't recommened to those who have PTSD or any kind of physical violence trauma. Apart from that, the chemistry between Shannon and Jhonny was amazing and the real life ways they struggled to be with each other  made it more satifying and rewarding to read.
