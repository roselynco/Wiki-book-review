## *My Thoughts* üí≠
This book really stood out to me as Danila Vassallo is an influncer who had always been super possitive. Though she talked about her journey through depression on most of her post, the release of this book and the storie in it truly made me realize a lot about the side of social media we dont get to see. It feels personal and comforting, almost like a conversation with  a friend who knows the struggles to heal  after certain situations. I have sat down with my best friend and did the self-reflection questions and guidance and it truly feels like its own type of theraphy. It's the kind of book that someone needs when going through tough times emotionally or mentally, to know they are not alone.



## Perfect Targetted Audienceüî•: 
- Anyone on a self-worth journey
- People who enjoy journaling and guided reflections
- Those who need  remidner to be kind to themselves.
